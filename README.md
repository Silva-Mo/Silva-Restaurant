## About
That is my third TOP JS project. It requires a good understanding of JS modules and Webpack skills

Alhamdulillah

## What was needed to complete it:
- Understanding how Webpack works
- JS modules

## Challenges that I've overcome: 
- Deployment of dist directory into a separate branch for more organization and to deploy the final index.html page in Github Pages
